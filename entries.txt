"During my going-away meeting with Gender Studies, the faculty gave me this
journal. In it I’ll report my descent into the post-cerebral realm for which I
am headed. No whimpering, no whining, no despair. Just the facts."

"Saturday at the mall I performed the physical motions of shoplifting—walked
out of Macy’s with a pair of pants over my arm. I only noticed when I was
inside Dillard’s on the opposite side of the mall. I hurried back, ready to
explain. There were no salespeople around, and no one noticed when I put them
back."

write an uncomplicated book without big words or much learning. Would I be
able to do that? I will try. The least is that I will have a book to my name.
Most importantly, it will create an activity here in my retirement center
where I spend most of my time alone. In any other private house I would have
been alone too."

became ill last year in early February; after my illness, however, I could not
even write my name or write as I’m doing here now. What used to be everyday
things had to come back gradually."

However, what about the wherewithal of which loneliness snips the wings? Or those like me, who “struggle to keep busy,” if one can even call that an activity? When I am not busy, I am lonely."

text: "Radio without Borders had an open discussion today on the relationship between children and elderly parents. This topic has kept me busy (seriously) for the past year. I have come so far that I say not only the children have to become independent from the parents, but also the parents from the children.

For me this process was accompanied by much quiet heartsoreness and emotion
and I had to work very hard at it. I gave my emotion and heartsoreness over to
the most holy in myself and to the Holy of Holies, since I feel I can love the
children more when I am not mad with heartsoreness or distracted by emotion.
To me love is openness in every direction, and in respect of my children this
is only possible if I expect nothing from them and blame them for nothing—then
they will come to me out of love."
